Learn to use GitHub. 

Hi, everybody!
This is my first time to use GitHub. I want to learn how to use GitHub to creat my own project.
The projects on GitHub have benefited me a lot. Now, I am trying to learn to use it for recording, sharing and learning more. 
The motivation comes from  the learning of TensorFlow. There are much useful information helping us get a quick start to tf. I want to record and share them as well as my understanding to help others get a quick start to tf.

By the way, when you want to do something, just do it! Never wait for anything!
GitHub or TensorFlow is a tool and is just a tool, we need to learn it and know how to use it. And that is enough. Try to remember, the problem that we use the tool to solve is more important. (problems ==> ideas ==> tools)
